Reasons to Ban Plastic Bags
There are numerous reasons why the government of various countries has come up with strict measures to limit the use of plastic bags. Some of these include:

Waste plastic bags are polluting the land and water immensely.
Plastic bags have become a threat to the life of animals living on earth as well as in water.
Chemicals released by waste plastic bags enter the soil and make it infertile.
Plastic bags are having a negative impact on human health.
Plastic bags lead to the drainage problem.
Public Support for Plastic Bag Ban
Although the Indian government has imposed a ban on the usage of plastic bags in many states. But people are still carrying these bags. Shopkeepers stop providing plastic bags for few days only in the beginning.

It is time when we all must contribute our bit to make this ban a success. Thus we the educated lot of society must take it as our responsibility to stop using plastic bags. In this way, we can support the government in this campaign.

Some contributions that can be made by people are as follows:

Keep a Tab
In order to be successful in this mission, we must keep reminding ourselves about the harmful effects of the plastic bags on our nature and keep a tab on their use. Gradually, we will become habitual to doing without these bags.

Seek Alternatives
There are many eco-friendly alternatives to plastic bags like reusable jute or cloth bag.

Reuse
We must reuse the plastic bags we already have at home as many times as we can before throwing them away.

Spread Awareness
While the government is spreading awareness about the harmful effects of plastic bags, we can also spread awareness through word of mouth.
